# Movie Recommender System
Welcome to my Movie Recommender System project! ðŸŽ¬

Overview
This Python-based project leverages the TMDB movies dataset to create a powerful movie recommendation system. I have conducted thorough data preprocessing, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using various libraries. The heart of the system lies in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, where I employed the NLTK library and utilized stemming with Porter algorithm. The machine learning model incorporates CountVectorizer and cosine similarity from the scikit-learn library.
